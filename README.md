# LC2

LC2 (Lockdown Compiler 2) is a C99 compiler written in C++11. I started this in January 2021,
to learn more about optimising compilers, practice C++, and keep my busy during the UK's third
lockdown of the Covid-19.

* Written in C++11, keeping the code concise and readable using modern language and STL features.
* Implement most of the C99 standard
* Optimising compiler supported by SSA linear IR
* TDD - including unit tests (using GoogleTest) and functional tests (using PyTest)
